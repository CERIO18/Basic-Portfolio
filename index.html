<p>
I am a native of Denver and have lived here most of my life. I enjoy working with others, being creative and
simply
enjoying life! I am passionate about design and creating things that are aesthetically pleasing. I love details in
all their forms. I have a strong background in the printing industry and am currently working on obtaining a
degree
in graphic design. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, camping and anything outdoors that allows me to experience the
beauty of Colorado.
